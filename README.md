# Bank Loan Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or denied by a bank. The prediction is based on various features related to the applicant's financial history, credit score, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create a reliable machine learning model that can assist banks in making informed decisions about loan approvals.

This project aims to try out different modelling techniques and compare their results.
